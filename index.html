                <h2>vision</h2>
                <p>At this moment my whole imagination is occupied only by the thought of progranning. I love to think,but even more to fulfill. I'm just view the programming in my mind at the moment. So i will make it a reality in-sha-allah. That's why i want everyone's prayers</p>

                <p>If every person wants to do somethimg in life,he must first define his goal. Maybe it's a little late to set my goals in life. I like to stay online,then i am interested in this sector. And by the grace of allah, i got the opportunity from my friend. Now i want to move forward with a lot of effort. Now my goal is only programming. I went to stick to this gosl. This is my dream and my goal</p>

            <h1>Develop without limits</h1>
            <p>There is no end to human learning. Similar is the teaching of analog programming. Programming is a learing task but not an end in itself. So it has to be learned infinitely, as far as it can be learned. The more you learn, the more you will improve</p>
